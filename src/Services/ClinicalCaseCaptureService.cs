Scenario Overview</h3>\nCreate a succinct, structured clinical vignette (2-3 sentences) clearly restating the scenario professionally and concisely for student reference.\n\n<h3>üéØ 2. Key Learning Points</h3>\nList 3-5 clear, concise bullet points highlighting fundamental clinical learning aspects relevant to the patient's presentation. Tailor specifically for UKMLA preparation.\n\n<h3>üîç 3. Possible Differential Diagnoses</h3>\nProvide a concise, prioritised bullet-point list (3-5 items) of relevant differential diagnoses.\n\n<h3>üìå 4. Management Plan</h3>\nClearly outline step-by-step initial management following current NICE or UK national guidelines.
