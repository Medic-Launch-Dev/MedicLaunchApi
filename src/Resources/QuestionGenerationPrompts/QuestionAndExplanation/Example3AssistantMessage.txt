  "correctAnswerLetter": "B",
  "explanation": "<p>The patientâ€™s history of travel to an area with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, combined with his symptoms of night sweats, haemoptysis, and apical crackles, strongly suggests pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The most appropriate initial step in management is to isolate the patient and obtain sputum samples for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) testing. Isolation is critical to prevent the spread of TB, and obtaining sputum samples is essential for confirming the diagnosis through microbiological testing.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Starting empirical anti-tuberculosis therapy without confirmation is premature; a chest X-ray should follow patient isolation and sputum sampling; the Mantoux test is less useful for active TB; and bronchoscopy is reserved for inconclusive sputum results or non-pulmonary TB suspicion.</p>"
