  "correctAnswerLetter": "A",
  "explanation": "<p>The single most likely diagnosis is colorectal cancer, as the patient presents with classic red-flag symptoms, including a persistent change in bowel habits, iron-deficiency anaemia, fatigue, and rectal bleeding. While haemorrhoids are noted on examination, they do not account for systemic symptoms like anaemia or changes in bowel habits and should not be considered the sole cause of rectal bleeding in this context, particularly in an older patient.</p><p></p><p>Haemorrhoids typically cause bright red bleeding with defecation but do not explain iron-deficiency anaemia or altered bowel habits. Diverticular disease can cause rectal bleeding and bowel habit changes but is less likely to cause anaemia or fatigue without significant complications like chronic blood loss. Ulcerative colitis may present with rectal bleeding and anaemia, but it typically includes chronic abdominal pain, weight loss, or systemic symptoms like fever. Ischaemic colitis usually presents with acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea, not a chronic change in bowel habits or anaemia.</p>"
