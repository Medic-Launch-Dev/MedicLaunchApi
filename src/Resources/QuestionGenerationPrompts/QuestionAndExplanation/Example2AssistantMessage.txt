  "questionText": "<p>A 24-year-old male presents to the Emergency Department with a 5-day history of worsening fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, and chest discomfort. He reports having a \"cold\" two weeks ago with symptoms of a sore throat, runny nose, and mild fever, which resolved on its own. Observations include a pulse of 110/min, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia with non-specific ST-segment changes. A troponin test is positive, and a bedside echocardiogram reveals a mildly reduced ejection fraction.</p><p></p><p><strong>What is the most likely diagnosis?</strong></p>",

  "correctAnswerLetter": "B",
  "explanation": "<p>Acute myocarditis is the most likely diagnosis because it often follows a viral infection and presents with symptoms of heart failure or chest pain. The history of a recent \"cold,\" combined with the cardiac symptoms, positive troponin, and reduced ejection fraction on echocardiogram, all point towards myocarditis as the underlying cause.</p><p></p><p>Acute coronary syndrome is less likely due to the patientâ€™s age, lack of risk factors, and viral history. Pulmonary embolism usually presents with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath but does not account for reduced ejection fraction or viral illness. Pericarditis may cause chest pain and ECG changes but not typically a reduced ejection fraction. Viral pleuritis could cause chest pain but doesn't explain the positive troponin or reduced ejection fraction.</p>"
